# PCB Designs
The original PCB was designed in KiKad. While attempting to order another copy of the PCB suitable parts were not able to be sourced.

During the update decided to migrate the project to EasyEDA to leverage tight integration with LCSC, these are located under EasyEDA.

All Gerbers, BOM and CPL files generated are within each respective folder.
